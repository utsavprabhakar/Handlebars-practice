Bank frauds rise by 74% during FY 2018-19: RBI

The Annual Report of the Reserve Bank of India, in the Financial Year 2018-2019, the bank frauds have increased close to 74%. The RBI has detected total fraud amounting to 71,500 crores. This amount is strong enough to cause an impediment in the Indian economy.

Risk Comment:  Most of the frauds that are getting reported are credit-related, and they are not black and white like operational frauds. A company can fail due to adverse economic situation, bad management or liquidity squeeze, but it's not so easy to determine the exact cause of fraud. Following of the money trail is impossible after it crosses borders. As per the latest RBI data, an unprecedented 6,801 frauds, totaling Rs 71,500 crore, were detected in FY19. That amounts to a 15% rise in volume and 80% climb in value from last year.

DGCA cautions airlines on travel over West Asia amid spike in US-Iran tensions

India's aviation regulator has cautioned airlines to remain vigilant while traveling over West Asia following a recent flare up in tensions between the US and Iran, an official said. Arun Kumar, chief of Directorate General of Civil Aviation, told Mint that the regulator met with “concerned airlines and have sensitized them to remain vigilant and take all precautions". But he added that there have been “no formal instructions yet".

Risk Comment: Amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran, India's aviation regulator DGCA Saturday said Indian airlines have decided to avoid the “affected part of the Iranian airspace” and reroute their flight “suitably”. As the majority of Pakistani airspace has remained closed for Indian airlines since the Balakot strike on February 26, the decision to avoid affected Iranian airspace is going to further disturb the routes of their international flights towards Middle Eastern and European countries, and the US. Pakistan closed its airspace after Indian Air Force conducted air strikes on terrorist camps in Balakot in Pakistan on February 26. Since then, it has opened only two air routes that pass over through southern Pakistan and Gujarat.

Patna: Two accused of Kidnapping student from Patna mall, gangraping her

A college student was allegedly gangraped at gunpoint by two people in Bihar's Patna. The suspects, who allegedly kidnapped her from the parking lot of a mall in the city's SK Puri area, are also accused of making a video of the assault in an attempt to blackmail her.

Risk  Comment :  Rape is the fourth most common crime against women in India. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2013 annual report, 24,923 rape cases were reported across India in 2012. Out of these, 24,470 were committed by someone known to the victim (98% of the cases). India has been characterized as one of the "countries with the lowest per capita rates of rape". Many rapes go unreported in various countries including India. In India, consensual sex given on the false promise of marriage constitutes rape. The willingness to report the rape has increased in recent years, after several incidents of rape received widespread media attention and triggered public protest. This led the Government of India to reform its penal code for crimes of rape and sexual assault.  According to NCRB 2015 statistics, Madhya Pradesh has the highest raw number of rape reports among Indian states, while Jodhpur in Rajasthan has the highest per capita rate of rape reports in cities followed by Delhi, the capital city.

Mumbai:  2,700 railway mishap fatalities in 2019, lowest in 4 years

Mumbai railways in 2019 witnessed the least accidental deaths in the past four years. Nearly 2,700 commuters were killed last year, which is 19% lower than fatalities recorded in 2015. But the fact that the figure is in thousands means that efforts to minimize deaths have to continue on a war-footing, experts said.

Risk Comment:  The impact of railway mishaps is so great that it can be impossible to identify an individual killed. At least 24% commuters killed last year could not be identified.   Shodh website has been created by Police where photos of unknown victims are posted. Men formed 89% of the casualties in 2019, while track-crossing was the biggest killer. Over 1,400 commuters were killed crossing tracks, a penal offence, but efforts, such as building boundary walls and using concertina wire, seem to have worked as track-crossing deaths dropped by 10%, compared to 2018. Over 600 died after falling off locals last year.


Surat: Shatabdi express food leaves 35 women ill

A one-day picnic to enjoy ponk, a famed winter delicacy of Surat, turned into a bitter experience for a group of 35 women from Mumbai after they suffered food poisoning on-board Shatabdi Express.

Risk Comment:  Poor food quality and passengers falling ill due to consuming railways' meals has been plaguing the national transporter.

According to a roadmap drawn up by IRCTC, the plan is to rope in multinational players that operate lounges in airports across the world

Iran: Ukraine plane with 180 on board crashes after take-off from Iran

A Boeing 737 belonging to Ukraine International Airlines has crashed due to technical problems after take-off from Iran's Imam Khomeini airport. The plane crash that killed 176 people outside Tehran earlier today is just the latest in a series of deadly aviation incidents that have taken place in Iran

Risk Comment:  Modern aircraft are designed and certified to cope with an engine failure shortly after take-off and to fly for extended periods on one engine. However, an uncontained engine failure releasing shrapnel can cause damage to other aircraft systems. A spokesman for Boeing said the company was aware of media reports of a plane crash in Iran and was gathering more information. The plane manufacturer grounded its 737 MAX fleet in March after two crashes that killed 346 people. The 737-800 is one of the world's most-flown models with a good safety record and which does not have the software feature implicated in crashes of the 737 MAX.

An Iraqi security source said there were Iraqi casualties at the base. Senior Iraqi officials have added on their statements on that there were neither American nor Iraqi casualties resulting from the strikes.
